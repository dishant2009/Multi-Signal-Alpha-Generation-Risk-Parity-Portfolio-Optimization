# Multi Signal Alpha Generation Risk Parity Portfolio Optimization
## Overview

A comprehensive quantitative trading system that combines traditional factor models with alternative data sources to generate alpha signals and construct risk-optimized portfolios. The system achieves consistent risk-adjusted outperformance through sophisticated signal blending, dynamic risk management, and efficient execution.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Signal Alpha Generation**: Momentum, mean reversion, quality factors, volatility risk premium, and alternative data signals
- **Advanced Portfolio Optimization**: Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP) and Black-Litterman with alpha overlay
- **Dynamic Risk Management**: Real-time volatility targeting and drawdown control
- **Smart Execution**: VWAP, TWAP, and adaptive algorithms with transaction cost optimization
- **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Real-time performance tracking, alerting, and reporting
- **Production-Ready**: Docker deployment, Airflow scheduling, and horizontal scaling
